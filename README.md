# React Practices

This repository contains my learning journey with **ReactJS**.  
Each session has small practice projects built using HTML, CSS, and JSX.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` – Entry point of the project  
- `index.css` – Stylesheet for the project  
- `images/` – Contains profile or project-related images  
- Future sessions will be organized in their own folders  

## 🚀 Live Demo
You can view the project live here:

## 📝 Notes
- Built with plain React (no create-react-app yet)  
- Using **JSX + Babel** directly in the browser  
- Goal: Understand the basics of React components, JSX, and rendering before moving to advanced setups
